# Key Moments in My Life

## Early Life

I grew up in Toronto with an older brother. I played lots of badminton growing up and competed at the provincial level. I went to Earl Haig Secondary School, a high school in Toronto.

I was big into gaming, becoming a top 1% player in Valorant, Minecraft, and Roblox. I tried to get good at soccer once but ended up breaking my wrist, so that career ended quickly.

## Getting Into Tech

I got into tech at the beginning of high school because of my brother and dad. They showed me what was possible. I started building a lot more after going to my first hackathon in Grade 11.

Getting into Waterloo CS pushed me even deeper. I created a startup with a friend and we got flown out to San Francisco. My projects started going viral, getting hundreds of thousands of views.

## The Moments That Shaped Me

1. Getting my first 90% on a test in Grade 6 after being a failing student before that
2. Winning my first hackathon, realizing I have some technical talent
3. Winning a startup competition and getting flown out to San Francisco
4. Living in San Francisco and New York City, experiencing the tech bro life
5. My 18th birthday, realizing I'm an adult now with real responsibilities

## When I Started Taking Things Seriously

I started to really lock in during Grade 11. I realized university applications were coming up, which could change the direction of my entire life. That pressure made me focus.

## The "Oh Shit I Love This" Moment

I realized I loved tech when I saw how other people reacted to my projects. Hearing people say "that's so cool!" was amazing. But the real moment was when my products fell into real users' hands. That feeling is what drives me.
