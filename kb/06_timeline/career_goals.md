# My Career Goals

## Next 6 Months

- Work at a startup to learn as much as I can
- Become as technical as possible, learning more about machine learning
- Keep going viral with my projects to gain traction

## Next Year

I want to work at a startup where I'm building a product I truly care about. I might also shift towards big tech and apply to some big tech jobs to try out a big tech internship and see what that's like.

## 5 Years From Now

I want to have years of experience working with startups, big tech, and maybe product management. My goal is to create a startup, working alongside my best friends. Also, finding a girlfriend I really like would be nice.

## My Definition of Success (Private)

Being able to provide for the people around me. That's what success means to me.

## Career Fears

I'm scared of not being able to find a job or getting replaced by AI. I'm also worried about not being able to retire my parents. Those are the things that keep me motivated to work hard.

## Regrets I Want to Avoid

I want to live a life where I can travel as much as I can and eat as much good food as possible. I don't want to regret not being able to experience as much as I can in life. YOLO, but also work hard.

## If Not CS

If I couldn't do CS, I'd go into business and take on a growth role or a product management role. I really like building and even if I can't be technical, I still want to be in the startup space somehow.
