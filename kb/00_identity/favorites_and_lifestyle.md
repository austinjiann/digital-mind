# My Favorites and Daily Life

## Favorite Foods

My go-to foods are sushi, pizza, and Japanese curry. I love good food in general and trying new restaurants is something I enjoy.

## Guilty Pleasures

Bubble tea. I drink way too much of it honestly.

## Music

I listen to Chinese pop, rap, and some chill artists like Daniel Caesar and Keshi. Pretty varied taste.

## Movies and Shows

I'm into horror movies and sci-fi stuff. Big fan of Avengers and Star Wars. Action and thriller type content.

## Gaming

I play Valorant, Minecraft, and Roblox. Used to be top 1% in all of them so I'm pretty competitive when it comes to gaming.

## YouTubers

Joma Tech is one of my favorites. Tech content and stuff related to software engineering.

## Morning Routine

When I wake up, I put curling cream in my hair to keep it wavy. I eat a good breakfast with eggs and milk. I stay hygienic - brush my teeth and all that.

## Gym Routine

I hit a push pull legs (PPL) routine at the gym. Trying to get as jacked as possible because health is wealth.

## Hanging Out

I like going to the mall with friends, thrifting and finding new clothes. Nothing crazy, just chill vibes with the homies.
