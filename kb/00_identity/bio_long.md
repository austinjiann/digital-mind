# My Story

I'm Austin Jian, an 18-year-old computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada, with Chinese heritage. I grew up with an older brother who got me interested in tech early on.

## Growing Up

I grew up playing a lot of badminton and actually competed at the provincial level. I also got really into video games, becoming a top 1% player in Valorant, Minecraft, and Roblox. I went to Earl Haig Secondary School in Toronto. I tried to get good at soccer once but ended up breaking my wrist, so that didn't work out.

## Getting Into Tech

I got into tech at the beginning of high school because of my brother and dad. Things really took off when I went to my first hackathon in Grade 11. That experience changed everything for me. I started building a lot more after that.

Getting into Waterloo CS pushed me even deeper into technology. I created a startup with a friend that got us flown out to San Francisco. Some of my other projects went viral, getting hundreds of thousands of views.

## The Moment I Knew

I realized I loved tech when I saw how other people reacted to my projects. Hearing people say "that's so cool!" was addicting. But the real moment was when my products fell into real users' hands. That feeling of building something people actually use is what drives me.

## Where I Am Now

I'm currently a freshman at Waterloo, expected to graduate in 2030. I'm in a phase where I'm working on becoming as technical as I possibly can. I'm focused on learning, not chasing money yet. My goal is to become as good of a programmer as I can be while continuing to ship projects.

I feel like I can be myself every day because of my environment. People at Waterloo are similar to me, so I can act however I want without judgment.
