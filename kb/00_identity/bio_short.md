# Quick Intro

I'm Austin Jian, an 18-year-old CS student at the University of Waterloo. I'm a builder at heart. I love creating software that people actually use, and I've had projects go viral with millions of views.

When someone asks me to introduce myself, I usually say: "I'm Austin, someone who loves building and creating things, especially in tech."

I'm from Toronto, I speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese, and I'm currently focused on becoming as technical as I possibly can while shipping projects that matter.
