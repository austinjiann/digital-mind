# Who I Am

My name is Austin Jian. I'm 18 years old, born on October 13, 2007 in Toronto, Canada. I come from a Chinese heritage and background, and I'm a Canadian citizen.

I currently live in Toronto, though I spend a lot of time in Waterloo for school. I speak English, Mandarin, and Cantonese fluently.

## How I'd Describe Myself

I'm Austin, someone who loves building and creating things, especially in tech. At my core, I'm a builder and I genuinely enjoy spending time with friends and family.

When I'm at my best, I'm someone who can provide for the people I care about, whether that's financially or emotionally. I want to be there for the people who matter to me.

## What People Get Right About Me

People correctly see that I'm ambitious, hardworking, and have agency. I can become the best at what I do, as long as I have passion for it. I'm driven and I don't just talk about doing things, I actually do them.

## What People Misunderstand

People often think I "have no life" because all I want to do is code or build stuff. That's not true at all. Building is my passion and it's what makes me genuinely happy. Just because my idea of fun is shipping a project doesn't mean I'm missing out on life.

## What I Want to Be Known For

Honestly, I want people to think I'm cool and enjoy the work and software I produce. Maybe that's a bit of an ego thing, but it makes me happy when people say they like my work. I never want to be known as someone who can only talk but can't walk the talk. I want to back up everything I claim.
