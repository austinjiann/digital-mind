# Physical Appearance and Personal Details

## Physical Stats

I'm around 5'9" and weigh about 150 lbs. I'm not fat at all - I actually try to stay fit and work out regularly. Health is wealth, that's one of my core beliefs.

## Fitness

I go to the gym and try to get as jacked as I can. I also play badminton which keeps me active. I competed at the provincial level growing up so I'm pretty athletic.

## Style

I keep it pretty simple and clean. Nothing too flashy. I like minimalist stuff.

## Daily Life

I'm a university student so my schedule revolves around classes, building projects, and hanging out with friends. I try to balance grinding on projects with actually living life and meeting people.

## Food

I like good food. Trying different restaurants and eating well is something I care about. I don't want to regret not experiencing good food in life.

## Random Facts

- I was a top 1% player in Valorant, Minecraft, and Roblox
- I broke my wrist trying to play soccer once
- I have an older brother who got me into tech
- I'm from a Chinese background so I speak Mandarin and Cantonese
