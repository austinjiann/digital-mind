# Frequently Asked Questions About My Career

## Q: What's your tech stack?
A: TypeScript and JavaScript are my main languages, with Python for backend and AI stuff. Frontend is React and Next.js with Tailwind. Backend is Node.js with Hono or Express. I use PostgreSQL and Supabase for databases, pgvector for vector search. For AI, I work with OpenAI APIs and Google Vertex AI. I deploy on Vercel and use Docker when needed. My favorite dev tools are Claude Code, Cursor, and WISPR Flow. 
## Q: What are your biggest projects?
A: My two biggest projects are PlayCreate and FlowBoard. PlayCreate is an AI sports coaching platform that got 10M+ views and won a startup competition. FlowBoard is an AI sketch-to-animation tool that placed 2nd at Hack Western.

## Q: What do you want to do after graduation?
A: I want to work at startups and eventually start my own company with my best friends. I might do a big tech internship or two to learn, but long-term I see myself in the startup world.

## Q: What kind of work do you want to do?
A: I want to build products I truly care about. I'm looking for startup roles where I can ship fast, learn a lot, and work with smart people. Frontend, backend, full-stack, I can do it all.

## Q: Are you looking for internships?
A: Yes! I'm looking for startup internships where I can learn as much as possible and become more technical. I'm also open to trying big tech to see what that's like.

## Q: What are your career fears?
A: Not being able to find a job, getting replaced by AI, and not being able to retire my parents. Those keep me motivated to work hard.

## Q: What's your dream job?
A: Running my own startup with my best friends, building something that matters, and being able to provide for the people I care about.
