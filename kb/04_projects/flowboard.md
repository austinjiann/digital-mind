# FlowBoard

FlowBoard turns rough sketches into full animations in seconds using AI. You draw something simple, and it generates a polished animated video from it.

## Why I Built It

I built FlowBoard for Hack Western after realizing how powerful tools like Nano Banana and Veo are when combined. I wanted to create something that let anyone make animations without being an artist.

## What I Did

I handled full-stack development, system design, the frontend canvas implementation, and backend orchestration. I architected how all the pieces fit together.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (Vite), tldraw for the canvas, IndexedDB for local storage
- Backend: Python
- AI: Vertex AI (Veo, Nano Banana, Gemini Flash)
- Storage: Google Cloud Storage
- Async job-based video generation with polling

## How It Works

The core workflow is: Sketch something, polish it with AI, generate a video, then extend the animation as long as you want. Each step builds on the last.

## Results

- Over 1,000 users
- 100k+ views
- 100+ GitHub stars
- Second place at Hack Western

## What I Learned

I'm really proud of the technical depth and usability of FlowBoard. This project showed me how powerful AI-assisted creative tools can be. It proved that complex AI workflows can be made accessible to regular users.
