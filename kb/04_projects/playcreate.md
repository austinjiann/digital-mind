# PlayCreate

PlayCreate is one of my biggest projects. It modernizes traditional coaching boards using AI-generated animations and formations. Think of it as an AI-powered tool for basketball coaches to visualize plays.

## Why I Built It

I built PlayCreate for the Unfounders startup competition with the goal of shipping fast and going viral. The sports-tech space felt underserved and I saw an opportunity to make something coaches would actually use.

## What I Did

I handled frontend development, backend logic, the animation systems, and product iteration. I was deeply involved in every part of the product.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: JavaScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- AI: OpenAI API
- Custom coordinate-based animation system for the plays

## How It Grew

PlayCreate got over 10 million total views across platforms. The major traction came from YouTube Shorts. I also used Twitter to document the journey and network with people in the space.

## Results

- Won the Unfounders competition
- Over 1,000 users
- Partnerships with four basketball clubs
- Got flown out to San Francisco

## What I Learned

This was a defining early-career experience. It taught me about shipping quickly, growth hacking, teamwork, and discipline. Seeing something I built get millions of views and real users was incredible.
