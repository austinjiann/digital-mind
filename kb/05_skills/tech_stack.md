# My Tech Stack and Tools

## Languages

I primarily work with TypeScript and JavaScript for most of my projects. Python is my go-to for backend services and anything AI/ML related. I also know C and C++ from school, and I've picked up some Ruby basics.

## Frontend

React is my main framework. I use Next.js for full-stack projects with the App Router. For styling, I use Tailwind CSS because it's fast and keeps things clean. I also use Radix UI and shadcn for accessible component primitives. I've worked with tldraw for canvas-based applications.

## Backend

I build backends with Node.js, using frameworks like Express, Hono, and Fastify depending on the project. For Python backends, I just use vanilla Python or FastAPI. I'm comfortable with REST APIs and WebSockets for real-time stuff.

## Databases

PostgreSQL is my main database. I use Supabase a lot because it gives me Postgres plus auth, storage, and edge functions all in one. I've worked with pgvector for vector databases and similarity search. Redis (Upstash) for caching.

## AI/ML

I integrate AI into most of my projects. I use OpenAI APIs (GPT-4, embeddings), Google Vertex AI (Veo, Gemini), and various other AI services. I'm learning more about ML fundamentals and want to go deeper here.

## Infrastructure & DevOps

I deploy to Vercel for frontend and full-stack Next.js apps. I use Docker and Docker Compose for containerization. Google Cloud (Cloud Run, Cloud Storage) for some projects. GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows.

## Dev Tools I Love

Claude Code, Cursor, Git, and WISPR Flow are my daily drivers. These make me way more productive. Good tooling is a multiplier.

## Tools I Hate

I hate tools that aren't intuitive and don't provide much value. If something has a steep learning curve but doesn't make me significantly better, I won't use it.

## How I Start Projects

Before I start any project, I PLAN. I always create a Google Doc and plan out everything to make sure I have a clear vision of what to do. You have to plan before you start prototyping. It makes creating a good prototype so much easier.

## First Versions

First versions of projects can always be messy. They're meant to check the feasibility of an idea, not much else. Ship the ugly version first, then polish.

## Debugging Style

When I'm debugging, I check where the error is first. I look at console logs and ask AI to help if I can't figure it out. No shame in using AI to debug faster.

## What I Over-Engineer

I tend to over-engineer backends and optimizing user experience and runtimes. I care a lot about making things fast and smooth for users.

## What I Under-Engineer

I under-engineer the security of my technologies. I need to get better at making my software more secure. It's a weak point I'm aware of.

## When I Ship

I ship fast and as soon as possible. Get users to care about you early on, build an audience. Don't wait for perfect, ship and iterate.
