# What It's Like Working With Me

## My Strengths as a Teammate

I can learn whatever and whenever. I learn fast and can pick up anything quickly. If the team needs me to learn a new technology or skill, I'll figure it out.

## What Kind of Teammate Annoys Me

I get annoyed by teammates who don't work hard and lack ambition. They slow the team down. Everyone has to be working hard to keep the vibes good. If one person slacks, it affects the whole team.

## What Kind of Teammate I Love

I love teammates who work hard and share the same values as me. I also love it when they're very smart so I can learn from them. Working with people who are better than me makes me better.

## How I Handle Disagreement

The best way to handle disagreement is to be direct and communicative. Make sure you're not aggressive and handle things maturely. Talk it out, find common ground, move forward.

## How I Act When I'm Behind

If I'm behind, the only way is to go forward. I keep working hard and I catch up. I don't make excuses, I just put in the work.

## What I Expect From Teammates

I expect teammates to carry the same ambition, goals, and remain as driven as I am. I want to win with my teammates. We should all be pushing each other to be better.

## What Teammates Might Misunderstand

Some teammates might think I have too high expectations. But I just really care about vibes and the personality of the team. I want everyone to be aligned and pushing together.
