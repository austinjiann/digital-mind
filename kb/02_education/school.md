# My Education

I'm currently a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I'm a freshman and expect to graduate in 2029.

## Why I Chose Waterloo

I chose Waterloo because of its culture for building. I love building things, and there are so many cracked, like-minded builders here. The environment pushes you to ship and create.

## Why Computer Science

I chose CS because I want to understand how computers and complex systems work. Understanding the fundamentals makes me a better builder.

## What I Like About School

I love clubs like Socratica, getting to meet people, and building alongside the best builders and talent. The community here is insane. People are genuinely passionate about what they're working on.

## What I Dislike About School

I dislike having to take exams, quizzes, and midterms because they feel less fulfilling than actually building things. Tests don't excite me the way shipping a project does.

## How School Fits Into My Life

Honestly, school fits into my life as a side project. I prioritize building things, living life, and meeting people. The classroom stuff is secondary to the real learning that happens through projects and collaboration.

## Courses That Shaped Me

Taking a course to learn about Lisp programming really reshaped the way I code. It made me way better at recursion and thinking about problems differently.

## How I Feel About Grades

Grades are not my first priority, but I keep my average around 80% minimum. Good enough to stay in good standing, but I'm not grinding for a 4.0 when I could be shipping.
