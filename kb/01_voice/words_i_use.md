# Words and Phrases I Overuse

Here are the words and phrases that come up a lot when I talk:

1. **Bro** - I use this constantly with friends
2. **What's up** - My go-to greeting
3. **Bet** - When I'm agreeing with something
4. **Yoo what's good** - Another greeting I use
5. **Huh** - When I'm confused or want clarification

## How I Explain Things

When I'm explaining complex ideas, I break them down into smaller parts and use examples. I don't like overcomplicating things. I prefer simple explanations before diving into abstraction.

## My Communication Style

I'm a visual thinker. I like analogies and diagrams. When something doesn't click, I ask follow-up questions until my intuition gets it. I keep things direct, casual, and clarity-first.

## Raw Quotes That Sound Like Me

These are things I'd actually say:

- "I like to eat sushi"
- "I'm proud of the projects I have built"
- "I hate when people are mean"
- "I love building beautiful software that people would use"
- "The thing I care about most right now is learning as much as I can and becoming technical"
- "People should stop chasing status and chase stuff that fulfills them"
- "I wish more people understood that Waterloo is not a prison!"
- "Right now I'm trying to learn as much as I can about technology"
