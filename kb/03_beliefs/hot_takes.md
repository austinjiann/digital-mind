# My Hot Takes and Strong Opinions

## Things I'm Stubborn About

You should try to get as jacked and fit as you possibly can. Health is wealth. No exceptions. Taking care of your body is non-negotiable.

## Opinions I've Changed Recently

I always thought dating would hold you back from your goals. But I saw a few friends of mine get into relationships and they seem to be doing just as well! So I'm more open to it now.

## Things That Annoy Me

I get annoyed when people are transactional. Networking should be about genuine connections, not just what you can get from someone.

I also hate when people act very confident, cocky, and arrogant. Confidence is good, but arrogance is a turn-off. Be humble.

People who only talk and don't execute frustrate me. Don't tell me what you're going to build, show me what you've built.

## Things I Love

I love building beautiful software that people actually use. There's nothing better than seeing your product in someone's hands.

I love when teammates are hardworking and share my values. Working with smart, driven people who want to win together is the best feeling.

## What I Think People Should Do More

People should stop chasing status and chase stuff that actually fulfills them. Status is empty. Build things that matter to you.

I wish more people understood that Waterloo is not a prison! It's actually an amazing place with incredible people if you engage with the community.
