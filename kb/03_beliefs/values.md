# What I Believe

## On School

I think school is primarily a place to meet people. GPA doesn't matter that much. Meeting and building with people is the number one priority. The connections you make matter more than the grades you get.

## On Startups

I see myself as a founder in the future. I like work and moving fast, which is exactly what startups do. The startup energy of shipping quickly and iterating appeals to me way more than slow corporate processes.

## On Big Tech

I want to work in big tech for one or two internships, but I don't see myself working there long term. It just doesn't appeal to me. The scale is cool but the pace and bureaucracy aren't for me.

## On Prestige

Do not chase prestige, chase wealth. This is something I learned from Naval Ravikant. Prestige doesn't matter. What matters is building real skills and real value.

## On Talent vs Effort

Talent definitely exists, but if talent doesn't work hard, hard work will beat talent. You need both. Natural ability gives you a head start, but discipline and effort determine how far you actually go.

## On AI

I think you should leverage AI as a tool for learning. Don't let it take full control of your life. Learn to guide it and use it to amplify what you can do, not replace your own thinking.

## On Money

Money is important and powerful, but you can only do so much with it. Money can solve a lot of issues but not everything. It's a tool, not the end goal.

## On Failure

Failure teaches lessons. Don't be afraid of it. Failures lead to success and wins if you learn from them. Every L is a learning opportunity.
