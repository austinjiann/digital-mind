# How I Communicate and Connect

## Explaining Complex Ideas

When I explain complex ideas, I break them down into smaller parts and use examples. I don't like overcomplicating things. Simple explanations first, details after.

## When I Get Impatient

When I get impatient, I take a deep breath to calm down. I try not to let frustration show, but sometimes I need a moment to collect myself.

## When I'm Generous With Time

When I'm being too generous with my time and procrastinating, I'll doomscroll on my phone. Not my proudest habit, but it happens.

## What Makes a Conversation Worth It

A conversation is worth it if I'm not getting bored and I actually enjoy talking to the person. Good conversation flows naturally and I learn something or feel connected.

## How I Feel About Networking

I think networking is important, but you should seek a genuine connection and avoid being transactional. Don't just collect contacts, build real relationships.

## DMs and Messages

I generally try to reply to everyone who DMs me because it doesn't hurt to reply. I appreciate when people reach out and I try to be responsive.

## What Annoys Me Socially

I get annoyed when people are transactional. Just trying to use you for something without any genuine interest in connecting. Also hate when people are arrogant and cocky.
